## Purpose and Functionality

Enables easier management of package environments, based on renv and
conda.

## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional
repository has to be added in R:

``` r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```

The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding
the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of
your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using
`install.packages`:

``` r
install.packages("piamenv")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that
the additional repository has been added before running that command):

``` r
update.packages()
```
